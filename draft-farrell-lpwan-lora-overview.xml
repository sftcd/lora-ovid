   <abstract>
      <t>Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies
   covering different Internet of Things (IoT) applications.  The common
   characteristics for LPWANs are large coverage, low bandwidth, small
   packet and application layer data sizes and long battery life operation.  
   One of these
   technologies is LoRaWAN developed
   by the LoRaWAN Alliance.  
 LoRaWAN targets key requirements of the Internet of things such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility and localization services. 
   This document is an informational overview
   of LoRaWAN and gives the principal characteristics and restrictions of
   this technology in order to help with the IETF work for providing
   IPv6 connectivity over LoRaWAN along with other LPWANs.

   <section title="Introduction">

	<t>[[Comments to be addressed before publication are in double square brackets like this one]]</t>

	  <t> LoRaWAN is a wireless technology for long-range low-power
low-data-rate applications developed by Semtech, which is used in LoRaWAN
networks. LoRaWAN networks typically are organized in a star-of-stars topology
in which gateways relay messages between end-devices and a central network
server in the backend. Gateways are connected to the network server via IP
links while end-devices use single-hop LoRaWAN communication to one or many
gateways. All communication is generally bi-directional, although uplink
communication from end-devices to the network server are strongly favoured.
</t>

	  <t> Communication between end-devices and gateways is spread out among
different frequency channels and so-called spreading factors. Selecting a
spreading factor is a trade-off between required link budget and data rate.
Spreading factors create virtual and orthogonal non-interfering communication
channels that enable simultaneous transmissions.  Depending on the used
spreading factor, LoRaWAN data rates range from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps. To
maximize both battery life of end-devices and overall network capacity, the
LoRaWAN network infrastructure manages the data rate and RF output for each
end-device individually by means of an adaptive data rate (ADR) scheme.
End-devices may transmit on any channel available at any time, using any
available data rate.  </t>

	   <t> The consolidation of that technology and its important impact in the
M2M market, is triggering the need for end to end IP connectivity from end
devices to the backend server without the need of proxying roles taken at
Gateways. Due to the constrained nature of LoRaWAN devices, the compression
techniques developed by 6LowPAN become mandatory. The present document
specifies how IPv6 and the 6LowPAN architecture run on top of the LoRaWAN MAC
layer.  </t>

   <t>

The DevEUI is a global end-device ID in IEEE EUI64 address space that uniquely
identifies the end-device. The DevEUI is preconfigured at each node.

   </t>

   <t>

A LoRaWAN device addressing can be conducted in two ways. Over the air
activation (OTAA) and Activation by personalization (ABP). The former requires
2 MAC layer messages to establish the network address and security keys
(join-request and join-response). The latter assumes that device address and
security keys are pre-programmed at the nodes and the DevEUI is not mandatory.
Lately, the LoRaWAN Alliance is considering to mandate DevEUI in ABP mode.

   <section title="Security Considerations">
       <t>
      The transmission of IPv6 over LoRaWAN links has similar
      requirements and concerns for security as for IEEE 802.15.4. 
      LoRaWAN Link Layer security considerations are covered by the LoRaWAN Specification <xref target="LoRaSpec"/>.

	<section title="Implementation Status">

	<t>This section records the status of known implementations of the
     protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
     this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
     <xref target="RFC7942">RFC 7942</xref>.  The description of implementations in this section is
     intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
     progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
     individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
     IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
     information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
     This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a
     catalog of available implementations or their features.  Readers
     are advised to note that other implementations may exist.</t>

     <t>According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working
     groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
     benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
     experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented
     protocols more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups
     to use this information as they see fit".</t>

	<t>There are a range of commercial and open-source implementations of LoRAWAN nodes and components.</t>

	<t>[[Doubtless more and some more details TBD if we keep this section]]</t>

	<t>RFC 7942 calls for this information for each implementation if that's useful to 
	provide:</t>


<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The organization responsible for the implementation, if any.</t>
  <t>The implementation’s name and/or a link to a web page where the implementation
or a description of it can be found.</t>
  <t>A brief general description.</t>
  <t>The implementation’s level of maturity: research, prototype,
alpha, beta, production, widely used, etc.</t>
  <t>Coverage: which parts of the protocol specification are
implemented.</t>
  <t>Version compatibility: what version/versions of the Internet Draft
are known to be implemented.</t>
  <t>Licensing: the terms under which the implementation can be used.
For example: proprietary, royalty licensing, freely distributable
with acknowledgement (BSD style), freely distributable with
requirement to redistribute source (General Public License (GPL)
style), and other (specify).</t>
  <t>Implementation experience: any useful information the implementers
want to share with the community.</t>
  <t>Contact information: ideally a person’s name and email address,
but possibly just a URL or mailing list.</t>
  <t>The date when information about this particular implementation was
last updated.</t>
</list></t>
