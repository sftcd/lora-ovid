	  <t>Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies
covering different Internet of Things (IoT) applications.  The common
characteristics for LPWANs are large coverage, low bandwidth, small packet and
application layer data sizes and long battery life operation.  One of these
technologies is LoRaWAN developed by the LoRa Alliance.  LoRaWAN targets key
requirements of the Internet of things such as secure bi-directional
communication, mobility and localization services.  This memo is an
informational overview of LoRaWAN and gives the principal characteristics and
restrictions of this technology in order to help with the IETF work for
providing IPv6 connectivity over LoRaWAN along with other LPWANs.

   <section title="Introduction">

	<t>[[Comments to be addressed before publication are in double square
brackets like this one]]</t>

	<t>[[As on 20161004 SF got to ~page16 of LoRaSpec, I'm working down
that and extracting bits of interest to the various sections here.]]</t>

	  <t> LoRaWAN is a wireless technology for long-range low-power
low-data-rate applications developed by the LoRa Alliance, a pay-for-membership
consortium.  <eref target="https://www.lora-alliance.org/"/> LoRaWAN networks
are typically organized in a star-of-stars topology in which gateways relay
messages between end-devices and a central "network server" in the backend.
Gateways are connected to the network server via IP links while end-devices use
single-hop LoRaWAN communication that can be received at one or more gateways.
All communication is generally bi-directional, although uplink communication
from end-devices to the network server are favoured in terms of overall
bandwidth availability.  </t>

	  <t> Communication between end-devices and gateways uses
different frequencies and so-called spreading factors. 
[[Needs better explanation.]]
Selecting a
spreading factor is a trade-off between required link budget and data rate.
Spreading factors create virtual and orthogonal non-interfering communication
channels that enable simultaneous transmissions.  Depending on the used
spreading factor, LoRaWAN data rates range from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps. </t>

<t>To
maximize both battery life of end-devices and overall network capacity, the
LoRaWAN network infrastructure manages the data rate and RF output for each
end-device individually by means of an adaptive data rate (ADR) scheme.
[[This seems to contradict the previous sentence.]]
End-devices may transmit on any channel available at any time, using any
available data rate.  </t>

<t>This memo provides an overview of the LoRaWAN technology for
the Internet community, but
the definitive specification 
      <xref target="LoRaSpec"/>
is that produced by the LoRa Alliance. [[What is the right version
on which to base this? I'm using 1.0.1 from Feb 2016 for now. Is
that public?]]</t>

   </section>

	<section title="Terminology">

	  <t> [[Not sure if 2119 terms will be needed. Leave it here for now.]] The key
words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.  </t> 
	

	<t>This section introduces some LoRaWAN terms.</t>
<t><list style="symbols">

	<t>End-device: a LoRa client device, sometimes called a mote. Communicates with gateways.</t>

	<t>Gateway: a radio on the infrastructure-side, sometimes called a concentrator or base-station.
	Communicates with gateways and, via the Internet, with a network server. [[one only?]]</t>

	<t>Network Server: [[does stuff]]</t>

	<t>Classes A, B and C are classes of end-device. All LoRaWAN devices have
bi-directional radios. The minimal end-device is class A and all devices need
to support acting as a class A device. Class B have additional end-device
receive slots allocated for better gateway to end-device bandwidth. Class C
end-devices can receive at any time they are not sending and hence have even
better inbound (to end-device) bandwidth. Classes B and C are not further 
discussed in this memo. [[Are these really classes of device
or modes of operation?]]</t>

	<t>Uplink message: refers to communications from end-device to network server via one or
more gateways. </t>

	<t>Downlink message: refers to communications from network server via one gateway to a single
end-device. </t>

</list></t>

	</section>

	<section anchor="spectrum" title="Spectrum">

	<t>LoRaWAN radios make use of ISM bands, for example 433MHz and 868MHz
within the European Union and 915Mhz in the Americas.</t>

	<t>As with other LPWAN radion technologies, LoRaWAN end-devices respect the
maximum transmit duty cycle relative to the sub-band used and local
regulations. In many cases, this means an end-device only transmitting for 0.1%
[[check]] of the time. The precise details of the duty-cycle is region
specific.</t>

	<t>The end-device changes channel in a pseudo-random fashion for every
transmission to help make the system more robust to interference.</t>

	</section>

   <section title="PHY">

      <t>
       Figure 1 below shows that after a transmission slot a Class A device
turns on its receiver for two short receive windows that are offset from
the end of the transmission window. The frequencies and data rate chosen
for these receive windows depend on those used for the transmit window.
If a downlink message preamble is detected during a receive window, then
the end-device keeps the radio on in order to reeive the frame.
</t>

<t>End-devices can only transmit a 2nd uplink frame after the end
of the associated receive windows.

	<section anchor="mac" title="MAC Layer">

	<t>Uplink and downlink higher layer data is carried in a MACPayload.  There
is a concept of "ports" (an optional 8 bit value) to handle different
applications on an end-device. The header also distinguishes different
directions and whether or not an acknowledgement ("confirmation") is required
from the peer.</t>

<t>In addition to carrying higher layer PDUs
there are Join-Request and Join-Response (aka Join-Accept) messages for handling 
network access.</t>

	</section>

    <section title="Addressing" anchor= "sec_lora_addressing">
    
   <t>

The DevEUI is a global end-device ID in IEEE EUI64 address space that uniquely
identifies the end-device. The DevEUI is preconfigured at each node.

   </t>

   <t>

Device addressing is done in one of two ways. Over-the-air
activation (OTAA) and Activation by personalization (ABP). The former requires
2 MAC layer messages to establish the network address and security keys
(join-request and join-response). The latter assumes that device address and
security keys are pre-programmed at the nodes and the DevEUI is not mandatory.
Lately, the LoRaWAN Alliance is considering to mandate DevEUI in ABP mode.

<t>Once a device has joined the network, then a short device address ("DevAddr",
a 32 bit locally assigned value) is used in MAC layer messages.</t>

	<section title="Planned Changes">
	
	<t>As with many LPWAN technologies LoRaWAN is constantly evolving both
in details and in the large. For example, some detailed changes to the
cryptography used are being discussed within the LoRa Alliance. Whether or
not those result in backawards incompatible changes (things that affect
ciphertext usually do), will be apparent in the the latest LoRaWAN
specification.</t>

	<t>Various LoRaWAN message formats including the MAC layer have 
bits allocated that would allow for future changes to formats. In
such cases, gateways and network-servers will be expected to support
earlier releases, whereas end-devices may only support one version.</t>

	<t>There is also some scope for vendor-specific ("proprietary") 
extensions to MAC layer messages.</t>

	<t>Larger changes are being considered in terms of connecting together
multiple networks and allowing end-devices to roam over different networks.
These changes are expected to become stable in 2017. [[Just a guess, maybe
we don't want to say stuff like that, but no harm to let folks know roughly
what's likely to change in the lifetime of the LPWAN WG.]]</t>

	</section>

   <section title="Security Considerations">
       <t>
		[[TBD, explain keying, provisioning and roaming]]
  </t>

	<t>All MAC layer messages have an outer 32-bit Message Integrity Code (MIC) calculated
using AES-CMAC calculated over the payload (ciphertext).</t>

	<t>[[LoRaWAN has no built-in s/w update. That's a risk. And one it'd
be good to try fix in general. I can imageine that might be a wrench for
some folks.]]</t>

	<section title="Implementation Status">

	<t>This section records the status of known implementations of the
     protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
     this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
     <xref target="RFC7942">RFC 7942</xref>.  The description of implementations in this section is
     intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
     progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
     individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
     IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
     information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
     This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a
     catalog of available implementations or their features.  Readers
     are advised to note that other implementations may exist.</t>

     <t>According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working
     groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
     benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
     experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented
     protocols more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups
     to use this information as they see fit".</t>

	<t>There are a range of commercial and open-source implementations of LoRAWAN nodes and components.</t>

	<t>[[Doubtless more and some more details TBD if we keep this section]]</t>

	<t>RFC 7942 calls for this information for each implementation if that's useful to 
	provide:</t>


<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The organization responsible for the implementation, if any.</t>
  <t>The implementation’s name and/or a link to a web page where the implementation
or a description of it can be found.</t>
  <t>A brief general description.</t>
  <t>The implementation’s level of maturity: research, prototype,
alpha, beta, production, widely used, etc.</t>
  <t>Coverage: which parts of the protocol specification are

style), and other (specify).</t>
  <t>Implementation experience: any useful information the implementers
want to share with the community.</t>
  <t>Contact information: ideally a person’s name and email address,
but possibly just a URL or mailing list.</t>
  <t>The date when information about this particular implementation was
last updated.</t>
