                            LoRaWAN Overview
                  draft-farrell-lpwan-lora-overview-00

Abstract

   Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies
   covering different Internet of Things (IoT) applications.  The common
   characteristics for LPWANs are large coverage, low bandwidth, small
   packet and application layer data sizes and long battery life
   operation.  One of these technologies is LoRaWAN developed by the
   LoRa Alliance.  LoRaWAN targets key requirements of the Internet of
   things such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility and
   localization services.  This memo is an informational overview of
   LoRaWAN and gives the principal characteristics and restrictions of
   this technology in order to help with the IETF work for providing
   IPv6 connectivity over LoRaWAN along with other LPWANs.

1.  Introduction

   [[Comments to be addressed before publication are in double square
   brackets like this one]]

   [[As on 20161005 SF got to ~page22 of LoRaSpec, I'm working down that
   and extracting bits of interest to the various sections here.]]

   LoRaWAN is a wireless technology for long-range low-power low-data-
   rate applications developed by the LoRa Alliance, a pay-for-
   membership consortium.  <https://www.lora-alliance.org/> LoRaWAN
   networks are typically organized in a star-of-stars topology in which
   gateways relay messages between end-devices and a central "network
   server" in the backend.  Gateways are connected to the network server
   via IP links while end-devices use single-hop LoRaWAN communication
   that can be received at one or more gateways.  All communication is
   generally bi-directional, although uplink communication from end-
   devices to the network server are favoured in terms of overall
   bandwidth availability.

Internet-Draft                lora overview                 October 2016


   Communication between end-devices and gateways uses different
   frequencies and so-called spreading factors.  [[Needs better
   explanation.]] Selecting a spreading factor is a trade-off between
   required link budget and data rate.  Spreading factors create virtual
   and orthogonal non-interfering communication channels that enable
   simultaneous transmissions.  Depending on the used spreading factor,
   LoRaWAN data rates range from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps.

   To maximize both battery life of end-devices and overall network
   capacity, the LoRaWAN network infrastructure manages the data rate
   and RF output for each end-device individually by means of an
   adaptive data rate (ADR) scheme.  [[This seems to contradict the
   previous sentence.]] End-devices may transmit on any channel
   available at any time, using any available data rate.

   This memo provides an overview of the LoRaWAN technology for the
   Internet community, but the definitive specification [LoRaSpec] is
   that produced by the LoRa Alliance.  [[What is the right version on
   which to base this?  I'm using 1.0.1 from Feb 2016 for now.  Is that
   public?]]

2.  Terminology

   [[Not sure if 2119 terms will be needed.  Leave it here for now.]]
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This section introduces some LoRaWAN terms.

   o  End-device: a LoRa client device, sometimes called a mote.
      Communicates with gateways.

   o  Gateway: a radio on the infrastructure-side, sometimes called a
      concentrator or base-station.  Communicates with gateways and, via
      the Internet, with a network server. [[one only?]]

   o  Network Server: [[does stuff]]

   o  Classes A, B and C are classes of end-device.  All LoRaWAN devices
      have bi-directional radios.  The minimal end-device is class A and
      all devices need to support acting as a class A device.  Class B
      have additional end-device receive slots allocated for better
      gateway to end-device bandwidth.  Class C end-devices can receive
      at any time they are not sending and hence have even better
      inbound (to end-device) bandwidth.  Classes B and C are not
      further discussed in this memo.  [[Are these really classes of
      device or modes of operation?]]

   o  Uplink message: refers to communications from end-device to
      network server via one or more gateways.

   o  Downlink message: refers to communications from network server via
      one gateway to a single end-device.

3.  Spectrum

   LoRaWAN radios make use of ISM bands, for example 433MHz and 868MHz
   within the European Union and 915Mhz in the Americas.

   As with other LPWAN radion technologies, LoRaWAN end-devices respect
   the maximum transmit duty cycle relative to the sub-band used and
   local regulations.  In many cases, this means an end-device only
   transmitting for 0.1% [[check]] of the time.  The precise details of
   the duty-cycle is region specific.

   The end-device changes channel in a pseudo-random fashion for every
   transmission to help make the system more robust to interference.

4.  PHY

   Figure 1 below shows that after a transmission slot a Class A device
   turns on its receiver for two short receive windows that are offset
   from the end of the transmission window.  The frequencies and data
   rate chosen for these receive windows depend on those used for the
   transmit window.  If a downlink message preamble is detected during a
   receive window, then the end-device keeps the radio on in order to
   reeive the frame.

   End-devices can only transmit a 2nd uplink frame after the end of the
   associated receive windows.

   |----------------------------|         |--------|     |--------|
   |             Tx             |         |   Rx   |     |   Rx   |
   |----------------------------|         |--------|     |--------|
                                |---------|
                                 Rx delay 1

                                 Rx delay 2

5.  MAC Layer

   Uplink and downlink higher layer data is carried in a MACPayload.
   There is a concept of "ports" (an optional 8 bit value) to handle
   different applications on an end-device.  The header also



Farrell & Yegin           Expires April 8, 2017                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                lora overview                 October 2016


   distinguishes different directions and whether or not an
   acknowledgement ("confirmation") is required from the peer.

   In addition to carrying higher layer PDUs there are Join-Request and
   Join-Response (aka Join-Accept) messages for handling network access.
   And so-called "MAC commands" up to 15 bytes long (e.g. for [[what]])
   can be piggybacked in an options field ("FOpts").

   Payload lengths are variable with a maximum that is region-specific.

   All payloads are encrypted and ciphertexts are protected with a
   cryptographic Message Integrity Check (MIC) - see Section 8 for
   details.

   LoRaWAN end-devices can choose various different data rates from a
   menu of available rates (dependent on the frequencies in use).  It is
   however, recommended that end-devices set the Adaptive Data Rate
   ("ADR") bit in the MAC layer which is a signal that the network
   should control the data rate (via MAC commands to the end-device).
   The network can also assert the ADR bit and control data rates at
   it's discretion.  The goal is to ensure minimal on-time for radios
   whilst increasing throughput when possible.  Other things being
   equal, the effect should be that end-devices closer to a gateway can
   successfully use higher data rates, whereas end-devices further from
   all gateways still receive connectivity though at a lower data rate.

   Data rate changes can be validated via a scheme of acks from the
   network with a fall-back to lower rates in the event that downlink
   acks go missing.

   There are 16 bit frame counters maintained in each direction that are
   incremented on each transmission (but not re-transmissions) that are
   not re-used.  [[The 32-bit internal counter seems to conflict with
   the mode of operation of the crypto (that requires no re-use of the
   same key and nonce).  I assume that's one of the things-to-fix in
   recent discussions.]]

6.  Addressing

   The DevEUI is a global end-device ID in IEEE EUI64 address space that
   uniquely identifies the end-device.  The DevEUI is preconfigured at
   each node.

   Device addressing is done in one of two ways.  Over-the-air
   activation (OTAA) and Activation by personalization (ABP).  The
   former requires 2 MAC layer messages to establish the network address
   and security keys (join-request and join-response).  The latter
   assumes that device address and security keys are pre-programmed at



Farrell & Yegin           Expires April 8, 2017                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                lora overview                 October 2016


   the nodes and the DevEUI is not mandatory.  Lately, the LoRaWAN
   Alliance is considering to mandate DevEUI in ABP mode.

   Figure 3: DevEUI

   +------------+----------------+
   |  Bit#      |    [63..0]     |
   +------------+----------------+
   | DevEUI     |     DevEUI     |
   +------------+----------------+

   Once a device has joined the network, then a short device address
   ("DevAddr", a 32 bit locally assigned value) is used in MAC layer
   messages.

7.  Planned Changes

   As with many LPWAN technologies LoRaWAN is constantly evolving both
   in details and in the large.  For example, some detailed changes to
   the cryptography used are being discussed within the LoRa Alliance.
   Whether or not those result in backawards incompatible changes
   (things that affect ciphertext usually do), will be apparent in the
   the latest LoRaWAN specification.

   Various LoRaWAN message formats including the MAC layer have bits
   allocated that would allow for future changes to formats.  In such
   cases, gateways and network-servers will be expected to support
   earlier releases, whereas end-devices may only support one version.

   There is also some scope for vendor-specific ("proprietary")
   extensions to MAC layer messages.

   Larger changes are being considered in terms of connecting together
   multiple networks and allowing end-devices to roam over different
   networks.  These changes are expected to become stable in 2017.
   [[Just a guess, maybe we don't want to say stuff like that, but no
   harm to let folks know roughly what's likely to change in the
   lifetime of the LPWAN WG.]]

8.  Security Considerations

   [[TBD, explain keying, provisioning and roaming]]

8.1.  Key Management

   Keying for MAC layer payloads is specific to the port ("FPort").

   [[explain nw and app keys]]

Internet-Draft                lora overview                 October 2016


   [[explain when re-keying happens/is-needed]]

8.2.  Payload Encryption and Data Integrity

   All payloads are encrypted and have data integrity.  Frame options
   (used for MAC commands) when sent as a payload (FPort==0) are
   therefore protected.  MAC commands piggy-backed as frame options
   ("FOpts") are sent in clear.

   All MAC layer messages have an outer 32-bit Message Integrity Code
   (MIC) calculated using AES-CMAC calculated over the ciphertext
   payload and other headers.

   Payloads are encrypted using AES-128, with a counter-mode dervived
   from IEEE 802.15.4. [[add ref]]

8.3.  Other Security and Privacy Considerations

   [[LoRaWAN has no built-in s/w update.  That's a risk.  And one it'd
   be good to try fix in general.  I can imageine that might be a wrench
   for some folks.]]

   [[Describe privacy issues.]]

9.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations related to this memo.

11.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942
   [RFC7942].  The description of implementations in this section is
   intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
   drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual
   implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
   Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information

   presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not
   intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
   implementations or their features.  Readers are advised to note that
   other implementations may exist.

   According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   There are a range of commercial and open-source implementations of
   LoRAWAN nodes and components.

   [[Doubtless more and some more details TBD if we keep this section]]

   RFC 7942 calls for this information for each implementation if that's
   useful to provide:

   o  The organization responsible for the implementation, if any.

   o  The implementation's name and/or a link to a web page where the
      implementation or a description of it can be found.

   o  A brief general description.

   o  The implementation's level of maturity: research, prototype,
      alpha, beta, production, widely used, etc.

   o  Coverage: which parts of the protocol specification are
      implemented.

   o  Version compatibility: what version/versions of the Internet Draft
      are known to be implemented.

   o  Licensing: the terms under which the implementation can be used.
      For example: proprietary, royalty licensing, freely distributable
      with acknowledgement (BSD style), freely distributable with
      requirement to redistribute source (General Public License (GPL)
      style), and other (specify).

   o  Implementation experience: any useful information the implementers
      want to share with the community.

   o  Contact information: ideally a person's name and email address,
      but possibly just a URL or mailing list.
