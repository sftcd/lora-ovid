                  draft-farrell-lpwan-lora-overview-00

Abstract

   Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies
   covering different Internet of Things (IoT) applications.  The common
   characteristics for LPWANs are large coverage, low bandwidth, small
   packet and application layer data sizes and long battery life
   operation.  One of these technologies is LoRaWAN developed by the
   LoRaWAN Alliance.  LoRaWAN targets key requirements of the Internet
   of things such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility and
   localization services.  This document is an informational overview of
   LoRaWAN and gives the principal characteristics and restrictions of
   this technology in order to help with the IETF work for providing
   IPv6 connectivity over LoRaWAN along with other LPWANs.

1.  Introduction

   [[Comments to be addressed before publication are in double square
   brackets like this one]]

   LoRaWAN is a wireless technology for long-range low-power low-data-
   rate applications developed by the LoRa Alliance.  <https://www.lora-
   alliance.org/> LoRaWAN networks are typically organized in a star-of-
   stars topology in which gateways relay messages between end-devices
   and a central "network server" in the backend.  Gateways are
   connected to the network server via IP links while end-devices use
   single-hop LoRaWAN communication that can be received at one or more
   gateways.  All communication is generally bi-directional, although
   uplink communication from end-devices to the network server are
   favoured in terms of overall bandwidth availability.

   Communication between end-devices and gateways uses different
   frequencies and so-called spreading factors.  [[Needs better
   explanation.]] Selecting a spreading factor is a trade-off between
   required link budget and data rate.  Spreading factors create virtual
   and orthogonal non-interfering communication channels that enable
   simultaneous transmissions.  Depending on the used spreading factor,
   LoRaWAN data rates range from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps.

Internet-Draft                lora overview                 October 2016


   To maximize both battery life of end-devices and overall network
   capacity, the LoRaWAN network infrastructure manages the data rate
   and RF output for each end-device individually by means of an
   adaptive data rate (ADR) scheme.  [[This seems to contradict the
   previous sentence.]] End-devices may transmit on any channel
   available at any time, using any available data rate.

   This document provides an overview of the LoRaWAN technology for the
   Internet community, but the definitive specification [LoRaSpec] is
   that produced by the LoRa Alliance.  [[What is the right version on
   which to base this?  I'm using 1.0.1 from Feb 2016 for now.  Is that
   public?]]

2.  Terminology

   [[Not sure if this'll be needed.  Leave it here for now.]] The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This section introduces some LoRaWAN terms.

   o  End-device: a LoRa client device, sometimes called a mote.
      Communicates with gateways.

   o  Gateway: a radio on the infrastructure-side, sometimes called a
      concentrator or base-station.  Communicates with gateways and, via
      the Internet, with a network server. [[one only?]]

   o  Network Server: [[does stuff]]

3.  Spectrum

   LoRaWAN radios make use of ISM bands, for example 433MHz and 868MHz
   within the European Union and 915Mhz in the Americas.

   As with other LPWAN radion technologies, LoRaWAN end-devices respect
   the maximum transmit duty cycle relative to the sub-band used and
   local regulations.  In many cases, this means an end-device only
   transmitting for 0.1% [[check]] of the time.  The precise details of
   the duty-cycle is region specific.

   The end-device changes channel in a pseudo-random fashion for every
   transmission to help make the system more robust to interference.

   Briefly describe the technology.  Phy layer and modulation.  MAC
   operation and frame formats.

6.  Addressing

   The DevEUI is a global end-device ID in IEEE EUI64 address space that
   uniquely identifies the end-device.  The DevEUI is preconfigured at
   each node.

   A LoRaWAN device addressing can be conducted in two ways.  Over the
   air activation (OTAA) and Activation by personalization (ABP).  The
   former requires 2 MAC layer messages to establish the network address
   and security keys (join-request and join-response).  The latter
   assumes that device address and security keys are pre-programmed at
   the nodes and the DevEUI is not mandatory.  Lately, the LoRaWAN
   Alliance is considering to mandate DevEUI in ABP mode.

10.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942
   [RFC7942].  The description of implementations in this section is
   intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
   drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual
   implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
   Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
   presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not
   intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
   implementations or their features.  Readers are advised to note that
   other implementations may exist.

   According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   There are a range of commercial and open-source implementations of
   LoRAWAN nodes and components.

   [[Doubtless more and some more details TBD if we keep this section]]

   RFC 7942 calls for this information for each implementation if that's
   useful to provide:

   o  The organization responsible for the implementation, if any.

   o  The implementation's name and/or a link to a web page where the
      implementation or a description of it can be found.

   o  A brief general description.

   o  The implementation's level of maturity: research, prototype,
      alpha, beta, production, widely used, etc.

   o  Coverage: which parts of the protocol specification are
      implemented.

   o  Version compatibility: what version/versions of the Internet Draft
      are known to be implemented.

   o  Licensing: the terms under which the implementation can be used.
      For example: proprietary, royalty licensing, freely distributable
      with acknowledgement (BSD style), freely distributable with
      requirement to redistribute source (General Public License (GPL)
      style), and other (specify).

   o  Implementation experience: any useful information the implementers
      want to share with the community.

   o  Contact information: ideally a person's name and email address,
      but possibly just a URL or mailing list.

   o  The date when information about this particular implementation was
      last updated.
